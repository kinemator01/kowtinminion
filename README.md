# 🎵 The Kowtinminion Movement Website  

This repo holds the code for **The Kowtinminion Movement**, a fresh startup brand/record label that mixes **fashion, music, and culture**.  
The site is designed to showcase the vibe, push new drops, highlight the manifesto, and connect with people through fashion + sound.

It’s not just a website — it’s meant to feel like part of the culture.  

Main features right now:
- **Hero section with video background** (to capture the energy right away).  
- **Manifesto/About section** (what the Movement stands for).  
- **Fashion gallery/slider** (to showcase drops).  
- **Links to shop & socials** so people can join in instantly.  
- **Clean header + navigation** for all sections (Home, Fashion, Music, Store, Family).

Family page – highlight artists, collaborators, and the community.

Newsletter/Sign-up form – to grow the community mailing list.

Animations – smooth transitions for gallery + manifesto section.
